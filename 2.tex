Hey, welcome. Double click anywhere on the text to start writing. In addition to simple text you can also add text formatted in \textbf{boldface}, \textit{italic}, and yes, math too: $E  =  mc^{2}$! $\pi/2 = 90\o$. Add images by drag'n'drop or click on the "Insert Figure" button.

I would like to cite \cite{Shepard08Step} . It is really a great paper.
